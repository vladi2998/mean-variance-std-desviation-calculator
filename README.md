# Mean, Variance and Standard Desviation Calculator

This repo saves the first project to complete the Data Analysis course in FreeCodeCamp.org. This project is about a mean, variance and standar desviation calculator in Python, with help of Numpy library.

## Abstract

Create a function named `calculate()` in `mean_var_std.py` that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.
